# Simulating the Collective Movement of Fish Schools

Swarm behaviour is widespread in the animal kingdom. It occurs in groups of birds, bees and countless other animals - even humans. The goal of this project was to simulate the swarming behaviour of fish. More specifically, the schooling behaviour of fish, which refers to coordinated swimming. The developed schooling simulation is based on [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) algorithm that Greg Reynolds published in 1987. The algorithm consists of three rules that each individual of the group will follow. These rules are separation, alignment and cohesion. In this project, these rules were implemented and additional rules for random direction, predator avoidance and obstacle avoidance were developed.

# 模拟鱼群的集体运动

群体行为在动物界很普遍。它发生在成群的鸟类、蜜蜂和无数其他动物——甚至人类身上。这个项目的目标是模拟鱼类的群集行为。更具体地说，鱼的聚集行为，指的是协调的游动。开发的鱼群模拟是基于Greg Reynolds在1987年发表的[Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids)算法。该算法由三个规则组成，鱼群中的每个人都要遵守这些规则。这些规则是分离、对齐和内聚。在本项目中，对这些规则进行了实现，并开发了随机方向、捕食者规避和障碍物规避的附加规则。
